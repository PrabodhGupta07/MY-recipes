<h2>RECIPE notes</h2>
<p>The baking time can vary greatly for this cake. I've baked this cake in 3 different ovens and I've always needed different times which were from 40 to 70 minutes. The oven I have right now only requires about 45 minutes to get a nice golden color on the cake, whereas other ovens I've used required the full 70 minutes. Test if after 40 minutes to see what it looks like. The cake is done when it only jiggles slightly but feels firm to touch.
If baking at altitudes of 5000 feet or higher, keep this in mind:
Reduce baking powder: for each teaspoon, decrease 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon.
Reduce sugar: for each cup, decrease 0 to 2 tablespoons.
Increase liquid: for each cup, add 2 to 4 tablespoons.
Increase oven temperature by 25 degrees F.
Please keep in mind that nutritional information is a rough estimate and can vary greatly based on products used.</p>
